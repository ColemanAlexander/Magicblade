# Magicblade

A turn-based card combat game inspired by Slay the Spire, set in a medieval European setting. Players climb through a castle, battling increasingly difficult foes using a strategic deck of cards.

## Technologies
- C#
- (Add other technologies as you implement them)

## Motivation
The combat in Slay the Spire is so simple yet enthralling that I want to implement it myself but bring it to a different genre. I find myself spending countless hours of free time in that game so the formula seems great. Medieval Europe brings an element of war, witches, wizards, tyranny, rebellion and all that jazz into a melting pot of card based combat.

## Current Features
- Turn-based combat system
- Card Types:
  - Attack: Direct damage dealing cards
